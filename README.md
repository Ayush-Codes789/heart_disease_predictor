# heart_disease_predictor
his project predicts heart disease using patient medical data. It applies preprocessing with One-Hot Encoding and Standard Scaling, then trains an XGBoost classifier tuned via RandomizedSearchCV. A Scikit-learn Pipeline ensures consistency, and the final model is saved with Pickle for easy deployment.
